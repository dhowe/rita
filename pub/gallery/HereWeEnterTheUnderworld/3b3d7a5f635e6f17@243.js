At the third holy gate their (gullies|chasms|cracks) were closed as they squeezed themself through. 
At the fourth holy gate they were cr(u|a)shed down in their (chest|core), as though to create (diamonds|a black hole|shards). A great heat was (formed|fermented). 
At the fifth holy gate, their precious metals, their gold, melted in this heat and fell dr(o|i)pping around them. 
At the sixth holy gate, they learned to (walk|fall|wither|dream|slide). 
And at the seventh holy gate they felt how it was to be (a size|a being|a size|a size|so broken) that they could fit into the Underworld. `
