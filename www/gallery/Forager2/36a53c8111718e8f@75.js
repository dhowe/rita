<i>CHORUS are seated. They sing/chant all of this scene in minor scale, each line on one note, rising. 
They are perhaps the gods in the heavens, or the three witches, or the three fates. </i>
<br>
CHORUS
Inanna put on her royal garment
She covered herself with joy
She was decorated with splendor and luminosity
She wielded her weapon
<p>
(Carnelian|nagug|Carnelian) beads like fresh salmon
With lines of fat and rusting (blood|mud)
The furrows of her chest bones
Rising like wingstrokes
<p>
The taut muscles of her arms
Her hand raised against
The Lapis Lazuli Gate
She came out regally:
<br>
INANNA
Listen:
In my holiness no one questions my word (in heaven|on earth).
I have (the ax|the signet|the emblem|the throne|the foundation|the cilig weapon|the antibal|the mansium) and (the ax|the signet|the emblem|the throne|the foundation|the cilig weapon|the antibal|the mansium),
I go out like the (moon|star)light from heaven
shooting an arrow from the arm at (field|orchard|forest) like the bite of a locust,
flattening rebel lands with the harrow,
smashing heads like a falcon.
I spread (holiness|terror) through the land like a thread.
I was (walking|spinning|dancing) in the heavens clad in fearsome luminosity,
walking on the mountains,   wearing the brightness of the sun on the earth,
bringing out brightness,   washing the flowers in light. 
When I turned - turned to the heart of the mountain. 
I, the goddess, approached the (mountain|kur|mountain) and it did not fear me.
How can it be that the (mountain|kur|mountain) did not (f|F)(E|e)(a|A)(r|R) me?
That the (mountain|kur|mountain) (did not fear me|namara-abak), Inanna, 
That the (peak|kur-bad) of Ebih, the mountain, did not bow to me?
<br>
CHORUS
The King of the Deities Answered her:
<br>
‘My little one desires the destruction of the (mountain|kur-re). (What is she doing? |bidug cagbi ana abak|What is she doing? )
Inanna desires the destruction of the (mountain|kur-re). (What is she doing?|al bidug cagbi ana abak)
She desires the destruction of the peak of Ebih. (What is she doing? |al bidug cagbi ana abak)
The mountain’s radiance and terror spreads through heaven and through earth. 
Its magnitude extends royally,
(Fruit|Fruit|Gurun) hangs in its bounteous (orchard|kiri) and (luxuriating spreads,| rejoicing spreads,|girizal imdudu,)
(Its magnificent trees are admired|jic mahbi ur anna niba udide bagub|Its magnificent trees are admired). 
In Ebih, in the shade of its spreading branches, 
in the cyprus groves, deer and stags are in abundance,
in tall stands of grass are wild bulls.
Young woman,   Inanna,    you cannot oppose it. 
It’s a mountain.’
<br>
<i>INANNA is enraged by this answer. Throughout the next scene she prepares for battle.

CHORUS descends from heavens to become CHORUS OF MYCOLOGISTS, in the forest. </i>

…(so if you have your matsutake eyes on, and you’re looking for matsutake, you don’t see any of the boletes, you don’t see - any of the things that are interesting in the trees up above you, you’re looking down. You’re looking for something white. And if you see something orange you dismiss it - because it’s not something white. And, so, one of the things I find fascinating is, that lens - can change at the flip of a switch. You can be walking along looking for matsutake, and then it could be - I’m gonna go for interesting birds. Or I’ll look for lichens. Or I’ll look for - you know, something else. And when you make that switch - then you won’t find matsutakes. And that tunnel vision, it just shifts. It shifts. I really find lichens interesting, but if I look for lichens, then I won’t find anything else. And if I don’t look for lichens, they’re small enough that I won’t find them.|so if you have your Pluteus eyes on, and you’re looking for Pluteus, you don’t see any of the boletes, you don’t see - any of the things that are interesting in the trees up above you, you’re looking down.

MYCOLOGIST 1
Anybody - anybody? anybody? anybody? 
<p>
<i>MYCOLOGIST 3 comes to look at the mushroom too.</i>
<p>
It’s just - it’s so beautiful - and maybe on the way home it’ll suddenly come to me. 
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 3
A fibrous stipe?
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 2
We don’t know the spore colour -
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 1
well? - maybe we do… it seems (white|pink|beige), or - (creamy|peachy|lemony). 
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 2
This beautiful red base. It’s very distinctive. 
Oh, look!
<p>
<i>FORAGER wanders into view. An encounter. The MYCOLOGISTS and the FORAGER don’t know how to approach each other. When foragers meet in the woods, they are not sure whether they should treat each other like collaborators or competitors. It depends on how the season is going. 
In theory, they would encourage each other. This is a way of life that matters to them. But in practice, if someone is in their spot, it’s a problem. However, with Mycologists, there is another aspect, which is that they are interested more in the biology, ecology, relationships of the woods. Is the FORAGER helping to steward these relationships, or taking advantage of the ecosystem, taking valuable nutrients out of it? 
FORAGER is uncertain of what these people are doing in the woods. They’re clearly working at something. Curiosity abounds.</i>

Hello there.. 
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 1
Ah! Hello. 
<p>
FORAGER
<i>Pause. Indicating mushroom:</i>
Whatchu got there?
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 2
Well we are just considering the sporocarp of this fungus. 
<p>
MYCOLOGIST 3 
It’s very distinctive. And we - several of us have tried. And we can’t get anywhere really satisfactory.
<i>Pause.</i>
<p>
FORAGER
Ah. It looks - um, well. Gilled. But, not an amanita. 
<p>
1
No, indeed. So are you -
<p>
2
Foraging?
<p>
3
For mushrooms?
<p>
FORAGER
I’m not finding too many mushrooms in these woods. Strange year.
<p>
2
Have you met many other foragers here?
<p>
FORAGER
No. I don’t think so. There was a lady…
<p>
3
Not many trails come up this way.
<p>
FORAGER
No, but there’s a lot of (tarah-bi|deer|animal) trails. Seems like a real wild population. I even saw lions.
<p>
3
Lions!
<p>
1
Is this an ecosystem you’re familiar with?
<p>
FORAGER
I was somewhere I knew. But I’ve got off track, wandering up into this mountain.
<p>
2
Yes! The mountain!
<p>
3
The mountain is the subject of our studies.
<p>
1
The mountain is the subject of resource development.
<p>
2
Of fracking!
<p>
3
Of exploitation!
<p>
1
We’re investigating this as a potential location -
<p>
2
For an investigation
<p>
3
A bio-collection.
I am sure that for you, the mushrooms you pick end up in a cast-iron skillet with butter, however, not all fungi have such a fate! 
<p>
1
Yes, some fungi and lichens end up in a herbarium, where they remain as a biological record. 
<p>
2
A record of the place.
<p>
3
At the time. 
<p>
1
So it’s very important to us -
<p>
3
Most important -
<p>
1
That it remain pristine.
<p>
FORAGER
Pristine… 
<i>The MYCOLOGISTS gather together. They do a bobbing dance - stooping, studying gestures. </i>
<p>
MYCOLOGISTS
Pristine! 
The collection of fungal specimens is integral to documenting species diversity and distribution, and how these factors change over time. Fungal specimens are collected, identified, admired, dried, labelled, and packaged up to be stored in a herbarium. 
Preservation! 
And an understanding of the Geology, the Morphology, the Phenology-
<p>
1
We look at the molecular information, for phenologies
<p>
2
It tells us a story - one we don’t necessarily expect
<p>
3
There is so much to learn yet! So many directions that you can take!
<p>
<i>A rumbling starts. INANNA is descending from the heavens behind the MYCOLOGISTS, who are still in full flow. FORAGER is witness to the whole scene. </i>
<p>
MYCOLOGISTS
And the information is important for the conservation of these pristine spaces! This beautiful wilderness! 
And we have rules!

<p>

You won’t break the binoculars
You won’t shatter the sample slides
You won’t fail to tie your hiking boots
You won’t forget the tent and the pillow
You won’t let it go and work the contaminated job
You won’t pause the soil’s harmony and understanding 
You won’t pour ashes into the scattered streams
You won’t take the book from its wisdom,
You will prevent pollution from tumbling through the lands
<p>
INANNA


Since the Mountain did not fear me
I will teach the soaring peak the meaning of fear.
I will place a (magnificient|hulking|mah) battering (ram|gud) against its (magnificient|hulking|mah) sides.
I will place a (puny|tur) battering (ram|gud) against its (tur|puny) sides.
I will overtake it and play my (kug|pure) game.
I will bring battle to the (peak|kur-bad) and make conflict against it.
I will make arrows for the quiver.
I will form stones for the sling.
I will sharpen the spear.
I will set (fire|izi) to the edge of its forest.
I will put an ax to its wickedness.
May the Mountain quake when I approach. 
 

<p>
<i>The MYCOLOGISTS turn and see INANNA. They are terrified.</i>
<p>
MYCOLOGISTS
Emergency procedures!
<p>
<i>They run. 

FORAGER is standing. Heavy techno/drum n bass. INNANA starts smashing things up. 
In her motions, she pulls EBIH the character into being, who is sleepy and surprised and unable to defend themself. 

It becomes a dance party. The theatre is filled with music. Dark. Drinks are served. </i>
